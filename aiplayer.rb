# Phase Bonus

# Write an AiPlayer class for your Ghost game. You'll need to figure out the 
# logic for picking a winning letter on each turn. In order to do this, your 
# AiPlayer will need to know both the current fragment and the number of 
# other players (n).

# If adding a letter to the fragment would spell a word, then the letter is a 
# losing move. If adding a letter to the fragment would leave only words with n 
# or fewer additional letters as possibilities, then the letter is a winning move.
# Your AI should take any available winning move; if none is available, randomly 
# select a losing move.

# See if you can improve your AI by computing the entire tree of possible moves 
# from the current position. Choose the move that leaves the fewest losers and 
# the most winners in the tree.
